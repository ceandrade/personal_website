Carlos Eduardo de Andrade is a principal inventive scientist at the Network
Analytics and Automation department at AT&T Labs Research. He is a specialist
in prescriptive analytics and operations research, working with large-scale
combinatorial optimization problems using model-driven and custom approaches.
Scheduling changes on hundreds of thousands of nodes in a highly heterogeneous
network and optimizing parameters for hundreds of thousands of 4G and 5G
equipment is part of his daily job. Toss in other millions of Internet of
Things devices and connected cars, and we have very challenging combinatorial
optimization problems tackled by Carlos and his colleagues. In his hybrid
position, Carlos delivers solutions for his company as much as scientific
papers and open-source code for the community, regularly publishing in
high-quality venues such as EJOR and SIGCOMM. He is the author of the
BRKGA-MP-IPR, the best-performing genetic algorithm for real-world applications
to date. Before joining AT&T Labs, Carlos spent some time at the School of
Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech as a postdoc fellow and at
the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology Southern of Minas
Gerais as a professor. Carlos has Master’s and Ph.D. degrees in computer
science from the Institute of Computing at the University of Campinas and a
bachelor’s degree in computer science from the Federal University of Lavras.

Some current projects:


<ul class='fa-ul'>
<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-chevron-right" style="color: steelblue;"></i>
Network grooming, consolidation, and equipment decommission on-premises
datacentres and carrier hotels, focusing on space and energy savings, and CAPEX
and OPEX avoidance.
</li>

<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-chevron-right" style="color: steelblue;"></i>
PCI/RSI/SSB management for 4G and 5G networks, focusing on large-scale
densification of radio access networks (RANs). Several features have been
implemented in ONAP.
</li>

</ul>

Some past projects include:

<ul class='fa-ul'>
<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-chevron-right" style="color: steelblue;"></i>
Change management deconfliction and scheduling for hybrid systems including
physical and virtual network functions (PNF and VNF), radio access networks
(RAN), and software-defined wide area networks (SD-WAN). Most of this stuff
has been implemented on the ONAP platform;
</li>

<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-chevron-right" style="color: steelblue;"></i> 
ENDC (E-UTRAN New Radio Dual Connectivity) optimization, where we want to
maximize the performance of hybrid 4G/5G networks, using machine learning for
issue prediction, and configuration and parameter optimization; 
</li>

<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-chevron-left" style="color: steelblue;"></i>
The retirement of POTS (plain old telephone system), focusing on low costs
for customers;
</li>

<li><i class="fa-li fas fa-chevron-left" style="color: steelblue;"></i> 
Delivery of Firmware-Over-The-Air for connected cars, where we want to
guarantee the best network performance for such updates.
