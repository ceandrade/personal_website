abstract = "The Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is a critical parameter to radio access networks used by the user equipment, like a smartphone, to identify the cell to connect. The PCI misassignment leads to call drops, no voice/data connections, and other sorts of impairments. Many works in the literature only treat the PCI assignment problem from the technological constraints viewpoint. In this work, we take a realistic approach and incorporate several operational constraints found daily in carrier-grade networks. For that, we model the problem with multiple objectives with a strict lexicographical dominance relation. We solve it using a hybrid memetic algorithm with warm start solutions obtained by a constraint programming solver and intensification with path-relinking and custom local search procedures. The experimental results suggest that our approach is superior to commercial solver packages in several scenarios."
