abstract = "Change management has been a long standing challenge for network operations. The large scale and diversity of networks, their complex dependencies, and continuous evolution through technology and software updates combined with the risk of service impact create tremendous challenges to effectively manage changes. In this paper, we use data from a large service provider and experiences of their operations teams to highlight the need for quick and easy adaptation of change management capabilities and keep up with the continuous network changes. We propose a new framework **CORNET** (**CO**mposition f**R**amework for cha**N**ge manag**E**men**T**) with key ideas of modularization of changes into building blocks, flexible composition into change workflows, change plan optimization, change impact verification, and automated translation of high-level change management intent into low-level implementations and mathematical models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CORNET using real-world data collected from 4G and 5G cellular networks and virtualized services such as VPN and SDWAN running in the cloud as well as experiments conducted on a testbed of virtualized network functions. We also share our operational experiences and lessons learned from successfully using CORNET within a large service provider network over the last three years."
