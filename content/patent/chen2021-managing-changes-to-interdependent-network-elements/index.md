# Abstract.
abstract = """
The de-confliction algorithm combines the end to end topology of a service
with open change management tickets to allow an operations user to identify
conflicting change management activities that could impact service to one or
more customer edge nodes. Given an end-to-end service path with all virtual
and physical assets, the connections between them, and the redundant service
paths, the algorithm will show change conflicts that impact customer service
and recommend time windows where a change can be done without service impact.
The solution is unique in that it uses both the physical and virtual
end-to-end service topology to find conflicts across the different network
layers and organizations. This methodology will become more valuable in the
future as the industry moves to multi-cloud environments where changes not
only across a networkâ€™s assets, but also across different cloud environments
will need to be considered.
