# Abstract.
abstract = """
The first method and system that provide combined optimal cell PCI and RSI
allocation in 5G wireless networks. It essentially addresses PCI/RSI
requirements specific to 5G deployment. It provides initial optimal PCI/RSI
allocation and automated PCI/RSI adjustment based on neighbor relation
changes in 5G network. The system is implemented as a closed loop 5G SON use
case in ONAP/ECOMP platform. The system is policy-driven where requirements
can be added and/or removed as policies/rules.
This is a continuation from US patent #10,834,608.
