# Abstract.
abstract = """
Facilitating assignment of root sequence index while minimizing network changes
is provided herein.  Operations of a system include determining an initial
assignment of root sequence indexes for a group of network equipment.  The
operations can also include evaluating the initial assignment for first
assignments that satisfy a defined criterion and second assignments that fail
to satisfy the defined criterion.  Based on the defined criterion, the
operations can include updating the second assignments, resulting in updated
second assignments. Further, the operations can include determining a revised
assignment of root sequence indexes for the group of network equipment, wherein
the revised assignment comprises the first assignments and the updated second
assignments.
