# Abstract.
abstract = """
The novel idea behind our solution is to use device level location analytics
coupled with network load and performance metrics at radio level to create an
optimized schedule for an OTA software download campaign. Furthermore,
because optimization is computational expensive, we employ location analytics
to create car segments with similar scheduling characteristics (commute cars,
weekend cars, etc.) and then apply heuristic scheduling to the segments with
less network impact, leaving the high impact segments for the optimization.
This results in a reduced problem space for the optimization process thus
less extensive computation while still producing a highly efficient schedule
for software updates. This is a continuation from US patent #10,470,189.
