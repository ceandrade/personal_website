A framework referred to as COmposition fRamework for chaNge management (CORNET)
may integrate re-usable abstraction, modular composition with plug-and-play
capabilities, or automated translation of high-level change management intent
into low-level implementations and mathematical models. CORNET may use
real-world data collected from cellular networks (e.g., 4G or 5G) and
virtualized services, such as virtual private networks (VPN) and software
defined wide area networks (SDWAN) running in the cloud.
