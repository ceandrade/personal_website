# Abstract.
abstract = """
The novel idea behind our solution is to distinguish over-the-air (OTA)
traffic from all other traffic to internet of things. For OTA traffic, TCP
Low Priority is applied. For all other traffic, standard TCP is used. With
this solution, OTA flows only take up the unused portion of the network pipe,
being non-intrusive to all other existing traffic. As a result, network
congestion avoidance is achieved effortlessly while network capacity is being
used at the maximum level. Moreover, the QoS for all network users are
maintained.
