We propose an optimization approach for load balancing of (security) gateways
for such resource utilization is given as a function of traffic transformation
such as connection encryption. In such scenarios, the exact volume is
unknown as much as the CPU utilization as its function over time. We use a
chain of regression procedures and advanced mathematical optimization to
predict the CPU utilization and (re) balance the node assignment to servers
and/or design server pools for such operations.
