# Abstract.
abstract = """
Facilitating assignment of physical cell identifier under technological and
operational constraints provided herein.  Operations of a system include
identifying a first group of network equipment that includes a first
relationship status and a second group of network equipment that includes a
second relationship status different than the first relationship status.  The
operations also can include determining a first assignment of first identifiers
of a group of identifiers for the first group of network equipment based on a
first application of first assignment conflicts.  Further, the operations can
include determining a second assignment of second identifiers of the group of
identifiers for the second group of network equipment based on a second
application of second assignment conflicts. In an example, determining of the
first assignment of first identifiers includes resolving module-k conflicts
among the first group of network equipment.
