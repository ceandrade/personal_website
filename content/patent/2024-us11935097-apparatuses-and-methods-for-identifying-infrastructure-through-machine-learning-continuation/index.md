# Abstract.
abstract = """
The first method to automatic identify legacy structure plants (copper wire
lines and poles) in Plain Old Telephone Systems (POTs) (but not limited to).
The process makes use of legacy database information, geographical
characteristics, and cost assessment, combining machine learning procedures
with sophisticated mathematical optimization to automatically identify
removable infrastructure cost-efficiently. The automation in this process
reduces the human intervention, mainly in legacy and incomplete/incorrect
data, speeding up the assessment and optimizing the deployment of field
technicians, aiming to save in operations costs.

This is a continuation from patent #11,587,312.
